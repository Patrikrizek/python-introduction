# At your school, the front gate is locked at night for safety. You often need to study late on campus. There is sometimes a night guard on duty who can let you in. You want to be able to check if you can access the school campus at a particular time.
# The current hour of the day is given in the range 0, 1, 2 … 23 and the guard’s presence is indicated by with a True/False boolean.
# If the hour is from 7 to 17, you do not need the guard to be there as the gate is open
# If the hour is before 7 or after 17, the guard must be there to let you in
# Using predefined variables for the hour of the day and whether the guard is present or not, write an if statement to print out whether you can get in.
# Example start:
# hour = 4
# guard = True
# Example output:
# 'You're in!'
# Make use of the if statement structure to implement the program.

hour = 4
guard = True

if hour >= 7 and hour <= 17:
  guard = False
  print("You're in!")
else:
  guard = True
  print("Ask the guard to let you in!")
  print("You're in!")
